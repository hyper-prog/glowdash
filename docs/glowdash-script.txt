GlowDash scripts are useable under Action panels,
and also can be add to CommandLibrary (See big-sample-config.yml)

The lines begins with // are comments.

Every variables in this script has string type,
but you can use operators and commands
which interprets these variables as decimal or boolean

Available commands in GlowDash script:
--------------------------------------

	If a == b
	    // codes
	Else
	    // else codes.
	EndIf

	While a < b
	    // body
	EndWhile
    
	Return

	Return value

    //Prints the text to the console (log)
	PrintConsole textWithVariables

	Set variablename value

    //Runs a named ProgramLibrary element
	Run libraryprogramname

    //Runs a named ProgramLibrary element, and the return value is stored in the variable
	RunSet variable libraryprogramname

    // Same as variable = variable + value
	AddTo variable value

    // Same as variable = variable - value
	SubFrom variable value

    // Same as variable = variable * value
	MulWith variable value

    // Same as variable = variable / value
	DivWith variable value

	// Add some minute to a time, variable = "14:45" + 35 //Result: "15:20"
	AddMinutesToTime variableNameContainsTime minutesToAdd

    //Wait some milliseconds
	WaitMs milliseconds
    
	//Calls a http request and don't care the result
	CallHttp httprequest

	//Calls a http request and store the json result in a variable
	CallHttpStoreJson variablename httprequestResultedJson

    //Calls a http request and extract the specified elements from the resulted json and store it in a variable
	SetFromJsonReq variable httprequest jsonpath

	//Extract the specified elements from the stored json requested earlier by CallHttpStoreJson
	SetFromStoredJson variableToGet variableOfStoredJson jsonpath

    //After the script runs it refresh the related panels
	RelatedPanel Paneltype ip deviceid

    //Load exposed variables from the specified panel
	LoadVariablesFromPanelId panelid

    //Load exposed variables from the specified panel with a given prefix
	LoadVariablesFromPanelIdWithPrefix prefix panelid

    //Prints all variables to the console (log)
	PrintVariablesConsole


 Operators useable in expressions (Like If and While):
 ------------------------------------------------------
 
	==     Numerical equal
	!=     Numerical not equal
	<      Numerical less
	<=     Numerical less or equal
	>      Numerical greater
	<=     Numerical greater or equal
	eq     Strings equal
	neq    Strings not equal
	in     String in a comma separated list
	nin	   String not in a comma separated list
	booleq Compare sides as converted to boolean
